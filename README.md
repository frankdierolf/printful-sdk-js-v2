const printful = new PrintfulClient({
  TOKEN: '<PRINTFUL_API_TOKEN>',
});

(async () => {
  const response = await printful.countriesV2.getCountries();
  const countries: Country[] = response.data;
  console.log(countries);
})();
```

## Configuration

```js
import { PrintfulClient } from 'printful-sdk-js-v2';

const printful = new PrintfulClient({
  TOKEN: '<PRINTFUL_API_TOKEN>',
});
```
